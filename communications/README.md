# WebApp

A simple web application created in NodeJS and EJS. For the purpose of this module, the port number is exposed in the GitHub repo.

NODEJS Guide

Assuming that you are already in the communication folder:

1. cd web/server

- Check that there is no node_module folder, if there is delete it

2. npm install

3. npm run dev
   
   - To access TCP server endpoint, you may use http://localhost:5000
   - The express webserver with UI is run on port 3001 you may visit: http://localhost:3001/ to access the dashboard.


Note: If you need to view items in your current folder directory, please run the following command:

- ls
